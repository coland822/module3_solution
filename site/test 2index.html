Flip the thighs, then fry for another 2-3 mins until deeply golden and crisp on both sides. Flip the thighs, then fry for another 2-3 mins until deeply golden and crisp on both sides.

Fan out the avocado slices on top and sprinkle over the black sesame seeds. Drizzle over the dressing and top with slices of sushi ginger, if you like.

If you want to thicken the gravy, mix the cornflour with a splash of cold water to make a paste, then stir in 2 tbsp of the liquid from the slow cooker. Tip back into the slow cooker, stir and cook for a further 30 mins on high. Stir in the parsley and season again to taste. Serve with mash, if you like. Leave to cool before freezing.
